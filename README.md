Eden is a minimal game framework built on SDL2 and written in Zig.

The framework is currently pre-v0.1, but feel free to use it as a reference.

Usage:
* cimgui needs to be built separately. Plan to eventually build it in build.zig, but that's more of a nice-to-have task so...
* After that, cimgui.dll and SDL2.dll need to be copied to zig-cache/bin (or wherever the project .exe is output)
